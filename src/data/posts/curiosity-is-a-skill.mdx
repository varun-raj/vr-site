Curiosity is often seen as a childlike trait, but it is actually an essential skill for knowledge growth at any age. When we are curious, we are more likely to ask questions, explore new ideas, and seek out new information. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the world around us and a broader range of knowledge.

**Why is being curious about simple things important?**

Even simple things can be complex and fascinating. For example, have you ever wondered why the sky is blue? Or why water boils at 100 degrees Celsius? Asking these kinds of questions and seeking out answers can lead to a deeper understanding of the world around us.

If you ever asked yourself such questions, you're probably as curious as I am. And that's a good thing! In one of the speech of Steve Jobs, he mentioned about his curiosity in calligraphy and how it helped him to create the first Macintosh computer. That small curiosity helped him to create a revolution in the computer industry. You never know what your curiosity can lead you to.
